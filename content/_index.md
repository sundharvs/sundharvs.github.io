# Hi!

I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech studying autonomy, robotics and control theory. 

I'm passionate about building autonomous systems with strong safety guarantees in dynamic environments, which I'm working on at the [Safe Robotics Lab](https://saferoboticslab.me.gatech.edu/) and the [C3U Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/c3uae/).

In the past, I have
- developed perception and planning algorithms for quadrotors at [Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/PURT)
- verified aircraft control systems using model-based simulations at Gulfstream
