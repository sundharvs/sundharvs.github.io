# Projects

## [Autonomous Quadrotor Navigation](https://github.com/sundharvs/nist_slam_path_planner/)

Real-time trajectory planning algorithm in ROS2 C++ for quadrotors to fly though obstacle-dense GPS-denied indoor environments.
Won $55k at [2023 NIST 3D Mapping Challenge](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/past-prize-challenges/2023-first-responder-uas-3d-mapping).

## [Quadrotor Acrobatics with a Cable Suspended Payload](https://github.com/sundharvs/quadrotor-cable-load-mpc/)

Nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) for quadrotors to do flips and barrel rolls with a cable-suspended payload with safety constraints.
Written in Python using [acados](https://docs.acados.org/).

## [Aircraft Autoland](https://github.com/sundharvs/autonomous-aircraft)

Cascaded PID controller for aircraft to follow localizer, glideslope, and flare path guidance law.
I learned how to use the [Python control systems package](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.10.1/) for frequency-domain analysis
and [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com/) for simulation.
